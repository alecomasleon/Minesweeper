# Minesweeper
I made minesweeper!
Run Minesweeper.java as the main program. MinesweeperEngine runs the logic of the game, while Minesweeper runs the GUI, etc.
You can choose which level to play (easy, medium, or hard), play a game, and keep playing until you get bored.
Programmed in Java, with Java Swing for GUI.
